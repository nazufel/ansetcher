# TODO

As with any software project, there is always more to do. These are some things I know need to be improved, but they aren't critical right now.

* Add Github actions to automatically run the tests and run a build
* Add Github actions to create artifacts and a release upon tagging a commit
* Add the ability to have multiple secret file names such as: secrets.yaml, encrypted.yml, etc instead of just one static.
